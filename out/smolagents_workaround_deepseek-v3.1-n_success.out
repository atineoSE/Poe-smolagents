Thinking...                                                                                                                                                
>First, the task is: "Tell me the system specs". This seems straightforward. I need to get the system specifications of the current system.

>I have access to a tool called `get_system_info()`. From the description, it "collects basic system metrics." So, I should use this tool to get the system
specs.                                                                                                                                                     
>                                                                                                                                                          
>I need to follow the cycle: Thought, Code, Observation.

>In the Thought sequence, I explain my reasoning. I plan to use the `get_system_info()` tool to collect the system metrics and then return the answer.     
>                                                                                                                                                          
>Then, in the Code sequence, I write the code to call this tool and output the result. I should use `print()` to see what it returns, and then use         
`final_answer` to provide the final answer.

>Finally, the Observation will show what the tool returns, but since this might be the final step, I can directly use `final_answer` with the output.      
>

Thought: I will use the `get_system_info()` tool to collect the system metrics and then return the information as the final answer.
